## üìù Description

Safe Streets is an app, aiming to solve the 5th and 11th SDGs. The core idea is to help those who do
not feel safe on the street, especially girls and women, by providing filters (informative points)
and area-based maps (ranking of crime reports).

The three types of points are: danger (high recommendation to avoid the area), recommendation (
medium recommendation to be careful) and safe (advice to be aware of safe places in the city).
Danger (red) and recommendation (yellow) are community-generated features, while safe (green) are
official places, generated by the app.

The area-based map is coloured, based on official crime reports from city police. Thus, the user can
see what areas are better and what are worse.

After all, the app includes a forum for points discussion and making the area a better place, and
support emergency contacts. Also, there is a space for user profile settings and other
administrative features.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Flutter installed on your local machine. You
can follow the installation instructions on
the [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

### ü¶æ Prerequisites

You'll also need to have the following software installed:

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
  or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with Flutter and Dart plugins) for
  development
* A [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) account with the
  [Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
  services enabled

### ü¶ø Installation

#### üëÄ Frontend

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
   using `git clone https://github.com/Maksym-Bondarenko/safe_streets.git`.
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run the app using `flutter run` on emulator or your connected device.

#### ‚öô Backend and Database

If you want to start a local server, start Docker, go to the `backend` folder, open console and type
following commands, while running
your [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/):

1. `docker build .`
2. `docker tag <id_of_built_image> run_db`
3. `docker run -p 8080:8080 run_db`
   Those commands will start the server locally on your machine via docker.
   To be able fetch and save the points, you have to change in code `host` variable from its value
   to `"localhost"` (you need to uncomment some lines of code in `start_page.dart`
   and `dialog_window.dart`, that are mentioned in
   comments).
   You can try (e.g. via [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)) run a
   get-request: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/get/all_places` and see all
   already created points.

You should now be able to run the app on your emulator or physical device.

#### ‚ûï Notes

Currently our app is using Google Maps API Key, that is protected via Google Cloud Console and the
value are hidden in the Environmental Variables. If you want to use your own API Key, please, update
following files (You can follow
the [Google Cloud Platform documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started/api-key)
for instructions on how to do this.):

- `AndroidManifest.xml` (to run on Android devices)
- `AppDelegate.swift` (to run on iOS devices)
- `index.html` (to run on web)
- `index.html` amd `index.js` in `data-driven-styling`-folder (
  for [data-driven-styling](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/maps-platform/introducing-data-driven-styling)
  of the maps)
  Also, you need to change the API key in the source code in the file `start_page.dart`, by adding
  your own key in the `apiKey`-variable in `_onMapCreated()`-function (for fetching the
  police-stations and saved points).

## üíª Technologies used

For the proof of concept, we built a 3-tier application on the Google cloud platform. The
presentation layer was built on Flutter. For the business logic tier, we launched a docker container
on a VM instance using Flask Python. Finally, the database is a PostgreSQL server, which is stored
in Cloud SQL. The connection between the frontend and the backend was implemented using the REST
API.
Before deploying an application to production, we are going to transfer the backend server to Google
Kubernetes Engine. Since users will update danger points frequently, we will deploy an in-memory
database for the points.

* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - The framework used
* [Dart](https://dart.dev/) - The language used
* [Flask Python](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) - For backend
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - For Database
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - For running Server in a container
* [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/) - For maps and location services
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - For authentication
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) - For cloud services

### üö´ Limitations:

* Currently following pages are placeholders with dummy data and with no
  functionality: `dds_map.dart`, `edit_user_details_page.dart`, `forum_page.dart`
  and `settings_page.dart`
* As Data Driven Styling (DDS) by Google Maps for Flutter Applications is currently under
  development, we could not implement it into our maps
* Also, currently we faced problems with fetching data from the backend (markers of custom user
  points: DangerPoints and RecommendationPoints) on Android. On iOS it works on other hand. It
  should be a problem on
  Google-side ([Google Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/228091313?pli=1)
  and [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/109115)), so we are waiting for the
  fix to implement it in our app.

### üîÆ Future Work:

* Updating the current placeholders for the settings-page, change-user-details-page, and forum-page
  to provide a better user experience and more functionality.
* On the settings-page, add options for changing user preferences such as language, time zone, and
  notification settings.
* Restructure the source code by dividing it into multiple files and extracting it into reusable
  components
* Implement voting for points (dangerPoint, recommendationPoint and safePoint) and logic for their
  auto-deletion.
* Add overall information for regions from DDS, containing report details, such as: last criminal
  rate, amount of thefts; touristic advices for countries.
* On the change-user-details-page, allow users to update their profile information such as name,
  email address, and profile picture.
* On the forum-page, add features such as upvoting and downvoting posts, write own posts, and
  sorting posts by popularity, date, or relevance.
* Improve the user interface and design of all three pages to make them more visually appealing and
  easier to navigate.
* Provide clustering of map-markers by zoom-out.
* Add unit and integration tests for these pages to ensure that they are functioning correctly and
  to prevent any regressions in functionality.
* Consider adding support for additional languages to make the website accessible to a wider
  audience.
